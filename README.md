Allows transliteration **from** Thai script Pali **towards** latin script Pali

There are two writings systems in use for Thai script Pali and both of them are supported by the library :
- **Phonetic Thai script Pali** (mode 0): This is essentially regular Thai writing, you'll find this in use in chanting text books or wherever there is a need for non experts to be able to read Pali correctly
- **Standard Thai script Pali** (mode 1): this is the system in use in the Thai Tipitaka, it has its own set of rules that deviates from regular Thai writing

Status: Prerelease / WIP

For a library that transliterates the other way around see https://github.com/siongui/pali-transliteration/
