There are two writings systems in use for Thai script Pali and both of them are supported by the library:
- 𝐏𝐇𝐎𝐍𝐄𝐓𝐈𝐂 𝐓𝐇𝐀𝐈 𝐒𝐂𝐑𝐈𝐏𝐓 𝐏𝐀𝐋𝐈 (mode 1): This is essentially regular Thai writing, you'll find this in use in chanting text books or wherever there is a need for non experts to be able to read Pali. It's not perfectly accurate. 
- 𝐏𝐈𝐍𝐓𝐔-𝐒𝐓𝐘𝐋𝐄 𝐓𝐇𝐀𝐈 𝐒𝐂𝐑𝐈𝐏𝐓 𝐏𝐀𝐋𝐈 (aka virāma style) (mode 2): this is the system in use in the Thai Tipitaka, it has its own set of rules that deviates from regular Thai writing. See Wikipedia [Thai script#Sanskrit and Pali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_script?useskin=vector#Sanskrit_and_Pali).

The katakana transliteration scheme is **almost finished but needs testing and reviewing.**

For a library that transliterates the other way around see https://github.com/siongui/pali-transliteration/

The Digital Pali Reader offers several transliteration options. Drag the lower drawer up and click the "Cv" tab to see them: https://www.digitalpalireader.online
