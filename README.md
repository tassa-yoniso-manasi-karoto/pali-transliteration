This library provide transliteration from:
- **COLLOQUIAL THAI SCRIPT PALI** (mode 1): This is essentially regular Thai writing, you'll find this in use in chanting text books or wherever there is a need for non experts to be able to read Pali. It's not perfectly accurate. 
- **PINTU-STYLED THAI SCRIPT PALI** (aka virāma style) (mode 2): this is the system in use in the Thai Tipitaka, it has its own set of rules that deviates from regular Thai writing. See Wikipedia [Thai script#Sanskrit and Pali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_script?useskin=vector#Sanskrit_and_Pali).

For a library that transliterates from Roman to Pintu-styled Thai see https://github.com/siongui/pali-transliteration/

**A simple web user interface combining both is available [here](https://github.com/tassa-yoniso-manasi-karoto/pali-transliteration-webui)**
